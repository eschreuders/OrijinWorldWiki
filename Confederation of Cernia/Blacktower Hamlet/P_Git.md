Now a guard to the town of Blacktower. Little full-ogre brother of [Barbras](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FP_Barbras).

On a job for The Web, he was defeated and afterwards during the final showdown at the web, recruited instead of killed by [Draven](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Z_Player%20Characters%2FPC_Draven) for his new town.

Huge Orge, not very smart. Just tell him what to smash. Has a love for little trinkets.
