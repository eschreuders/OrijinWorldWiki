Drunken old man, grey beard, grey hair. Smells of old ale. Thick, red knuckles with inflammation. Sits in [Shanty's](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FL_School%20of%20Law%20and%20Balance) square under the daise a lot.

50 years ago when he was a young lad, a dragon made an emergency landing right in the middle of town. The crash into some buildings tore a few scales off, but apart from a few big gashes and a nasty cough, the beast was fine. It even spoke with him, asked about the weather and the fishing. Tasted tome ale. Then he flew off. Silver.

Disposition: Drunken, no one tends to believe his stories.
