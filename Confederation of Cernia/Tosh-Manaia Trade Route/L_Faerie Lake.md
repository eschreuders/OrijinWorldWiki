A lake said to house a bunch of faerie dragons. Adventurers often go there to admire the creatures and offer them a small gem. It is said such an offering will bring a blessing from [Prosperity](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Prosperity) The gems are glittering on the bottom of the lake.

Recently a [storm](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FC_Leto) has gathered above the lake having chased away the dragons to Shanty.
