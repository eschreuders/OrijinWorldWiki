Village about a day travel from the city of Tosh. Part fishing town, part town of rabble. You can get a bad ale here, basic supplies and there's sea serpent scales. The unofficial leader is [Bennett Vardas](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FP_Bennett%20Fardas). 

### Dragon Daise 
There's a small clearing in the village used for the fishing market. In it is a small dais with roof shingles made out of huge, greyish scales (polishing them will make them gleam silver). Some say it's from an enormous serpent. Others say a huge dragon landed here 50 years ago or so.

[Old Fisher Dan](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FP_Old%20Fisher%20Dan) will drunkenly tell you the dragon tried to strike up conversation and wanted to taste his ale.

### Agatha's Shed
Literally the shed of a rosy woman named [Agatha](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FP_Agatha%20Nellis). Located near the docks and has general supplies to fix things and some trinkets and smoked fish. 

### The Surfer's Couch 
There's a man here that likes to skid across the river waves with nothing but a simple sail attached to a narrow raft. His name is [Surfer Johnson](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FP_Surfer%20Johnson). He rents out his back room and a bench to travelers who need rest.

### Fairy Dragons
A bunch of Fairy dragons fled from [Faerie Lake](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FL_Faerie%20Lake) have set up camp near town. They are causing all sorts of mischief now.
