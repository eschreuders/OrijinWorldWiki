Marid woman with two sons, [Hydros and Aquas](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FC_Hydros%20and%20Aquas). The two always cause mischief and had gotten her pet elemental Flo lost on the material plane. She banished them there to find the poor thing.

Unfortunately one was banished back and the other fled back, both being quite worse for wear. Now she is planning to go do it herself.

Marid, slightly middle aged looking woman. Blue skin, dark blue and silver hair, very elaborately dressed in maroon silk. Big earrings with saphires. 

Disposition: demanding, convinced her sons need a lesson.


**Flo**: Small water elemental mixed in with dark blue sparkly gems. It's shy of most people.
