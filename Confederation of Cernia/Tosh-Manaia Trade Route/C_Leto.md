Leto was once a storm giant, looking for her brother, Storm. The music loving gentle giant had gotten a mountain boulder on his head and ever since has a tendency to wander. He is looking for a supposed third sibling, Jargef.

They used to live on the shore near Drenith but have drifted further and further upriver. 

Leto has fallen to illness and is now at the end of her life. Still wanting to find Storm, she has taken up recidence near Faerie Lake, turning into a thunderstorm. Storm Gian Quintessent.
