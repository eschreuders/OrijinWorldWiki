Lady in a lavish white satin dress with many layers and huge white feathers (roc). She wears a mask and has huge white hair. Her hands are gloved. No skin in showing at all. Behin the mask her eyes are solig golden. No pupils or whites.

She runs [Angel's](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FL_Angel's), a resort surrounded by a magic barrier constructed of old marble enbedded in the ground. Its magic contains a spell that holds the ones crossing in to never share what happened within the walls outside of them. (If anyone should do so, a celestial is summoned to fight them.)
