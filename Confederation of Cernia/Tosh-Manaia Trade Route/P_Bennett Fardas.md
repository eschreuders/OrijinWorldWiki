Human man with thick black hair braided back and a long moustache. His face is very dark and leathery from years of sun. He plays the fiddle. 

Used to be a fisherman, but now he repairs things around [Shanty](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FL_Shanty). He knows the area and the waters like no other (except maybe [Fisher Dan](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route%2FP_Old%20Fisher%20Dan), be he's always drunk) and has influence with the town inhabitants.
