Small community of houses centered around a courtyard with rose garden. Only widows and unwed women are allowed to live here. They look out for each other. 

Openly this community belongs to [Prosperity](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Prosperity) like the rest of inner city Tosh. Secretly the ladies believe in [Knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Knowledge), the god of understanding and completeness.

The shrine is located in the kitchen of [Pauline Welsh](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FCraftman's%20Street%2FP_Pauline%20Welsh).
