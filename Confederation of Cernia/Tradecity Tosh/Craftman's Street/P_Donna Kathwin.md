Human woman, shrouded in blankets, 92 years old. Is blind with long white hair that touches the ground. She usually sits in front of her house in [Hag's Corner](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FCraftman's%20Street%2FL_Hags%20Corner) mumbling in a language no one knows. Sometimes it's almost arcane.

Can induce visions from [Knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Knowledge).

Disposition: absent. Intense when having a vision.
