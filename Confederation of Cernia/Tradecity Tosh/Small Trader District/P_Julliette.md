Older elven woman, probably about the same age as [Umilythe](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMage%20Quarter%2FP_Umilythe%20Tortris). Her hair is silvery but her face looks young still. She had reading glasses on her long narrow nose.

The runs the quill and takes pride in make the finest stationary this side of the barrier. She likes the ebb and flows of live and to live within the bustle of the city. 

Disposition. Very calm, bit slow maybe.
