Used to co-own the [Golden Needle](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FL_Golden%20Needle) with [Barry](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FP_Barry%20Balinwood), his husband. Since saving the cleric [Naima](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FP_Naima%20Men) from a shadow with nothing but a torch, he had found his inner adventurer.

Told his husband he needed to sort things out and subscribed to [Dock3](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FManaia%20Flow%20Harbor%2FL_Dock3)

Halfling man with a square face and big sideburns, middle aged, somewhat grey at the temples .

Disposition: unassuming, yet adventurous.
