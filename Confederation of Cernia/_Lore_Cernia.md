### ~ Confederation of Cernia, the Three-City Alliance ~ 

Along the great river, between the Elf capital of Manaia and the Three Sister Lakes, lies a very unlikely alliance. After the attempted rising of Tiamat, a civil war, the turmoil of the Daianna Campaign, and the migration of the Orcs, the area around Fahlia had gotten very unstable. 

Former sister Minport, Bulwhark Fahlia and Tradecity Tosh decided to work together to form a clear answer to the threat of the more aggressive Three Sister Kingdom. Fahlia had the tactical expertise, Tosh had the trade rights and Minport had the knowledge and experience with Three Sister Invasion. The three cities formed an alliance to discourage any further invasions in the future. The treaty was signed in the year 386 AB and has been shaken up a few times, but never broken. 

The cities will protect each other in times of need and facilitate easy trade between one another along the Great River.

Over time, especially Minport has grown closer and closer to Fahlia. The last couple of years Fahlia has begun to help Minport build a small navy. Some voices in Minport whisper that Fahlia is trying to slowly take over and turn them into a garrison. 

Tosh, having exclusive trading rights with the Elves, remains the richer of the three. They often take the role of mediator if anything comes up. It's their power over the Confederation's income that keeps Fahlia in check.
