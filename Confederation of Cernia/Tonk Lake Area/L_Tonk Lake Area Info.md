## Tonk Lake area

South of Fahlia the eastern branch of the great river ends in what is called Tonk Lake. Tonk lake’s surface is about 1800 km2 and Downtonk another 800km2 (Scale: IJsselmeer+Markermeer are 1800km2)

The land around the lake is hilly and towards the south these hills get larger and harder to climb until the Orcish territories are reached, roughly a month of travel to the south. Around the lakes is a temperate climate, with more rain and downpours the more south a traveler will go.

Tonk lake itself is well known for a very specific kind of carp: the **tonkfish**. It is recognizable by its silver scaled back and a darker black stripe along its flanks. It is widely known as a delicacy and therefore transported and made into all sorts of products: Tonkfish ale, Tonkfish sauce and Tonkfish cookies are just a few examples.

The fishing and trade make the towns around this lake fairly prosperous.

Most people in this area worship **Consistency**, much like the majority of Fahlia. Other commonly seen gods are **Fluidity** (Muckies in Tosh and Three Sister Kingdom), **Blood** (Orc influences), **Prosperity** (Tosh influences) and **Knowledge** (Influences from beyond the Orcish lands, pretty rare).

Some say **Quathwendyl** the legendary sea serpent lives in Tonk lake. Others say this is just an old wive’s tale and people should drink less.
