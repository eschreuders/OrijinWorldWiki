The little sister of [Tonk](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Pantheon%2FG_Consistency), at least that is what the Tonkians say. The trade and fishing having to do with tonkfish is indeed not as big and the headcount of this town is smaller (around 300).  
However, if you ask someone from Silverwave, their reaction is most likely something along the lines of: “Yeah, well, tonkfish is not the only bloody thing in the world”. 

Being slightly more remote from Fahlia, but still well connected and on the road from **Makah**, Silverwave has a lively trade in things besides fish. The Makah people make great use of this town as an intermediate. Anything you want to keep out of Fahlia’s clutches? Send it through Silverwave. Things passing along the river past Fahlia will have to go through customs, but anything traveling via Silverwave and Tonk is less likely to be noticed. It takes longer, but the heat is off.  
  
Makah historically has a very mixed population with a majority of hobgoblins. It is therefore not strange to see hobgoblins in Silverwave or signs of some human-hobgoblin ancestry in the Silverwave families.
