Easy to reach by both boat and road, Tonk is the main port town of the lake district (roughly 500 people). This is where the majority of the trade in tonkfish takes place. It is run by a major elected from a council of established figures in the community. Many of the fishing is done by families who have been doing this for generations and they take pride. Names are passed on from one family member to the next and tend to have a number affixed to showcase this experience. (Nathan Tonkwise III, Janeta Tidesprung IV)  
  
Most of the people in Tonk are humans, especially among the somewhat traditional and closed fishing community, but other faces can be seen as well.
