The Jinn monastery is devoted to [**Consistency**](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Pantheon%2FG_Consistency). Both martially adept and wise monks are raised here. The monastery aims to keep a record of events in the world as to keep it Consistent. Monks are sent to all corners of Orijin to keep these records up to date. So if you need to look something up, chances are it can be found here.  
  
The monastery itself lies in somewhat of a weather vacuum. No rain ever falls in the area and temperatures are on the high end. Its water supply is a mythical spring at the heart of the temple.
