Fahlia is the first large city upstream from [[Minport]]. The king [[Sigismonte Iorio]] accepted the Duchy of Minport in their midst as a new duchy in their realm after the secession of Hadoken. Still recovering from the Great Civil War, the new prosperous region was accepted with enthousiasm of the nobles.

After 7 long years, the [[Campaign/Taking Tosh/Keth Hogar/Relations/Kingdom of the Three Sisters/Kingdom of the Three Sisters]] was severily weakened by a long campaign. Even though Fahlia itself was recovering from the Great Civil War, a few nobles wanted to take this opportunity and press Hadokens claims in the west. King Sigismonte decided to reinforce the west, but not campaign beyond it. This is when the Great [[Rantii|Rantii Fortress]] was build.

An internal strife about trading rights happened where Hadoken was killed (or murdered, depending on who you ask). This only fueled the flames as the Duchy now had no noble ruler, but a mayor regent. The duchy was now de jure independent, as the laws of the realm only describe the law of the king over the nobles.

The feuds threatened the state of the Kingdom, especially considering the increased rebuilding of the Kingdom of the Three Sisters to the west by [[Queen Triana Marqués - Lamiènt]]. A 'Realm of Peace' was enforced by Sigismonte, making the independence of the Duchy of Minport permanent.
