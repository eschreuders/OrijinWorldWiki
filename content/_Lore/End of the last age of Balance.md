At the end of the last age of [Balance](../_Pantheon/G_Balance), the world was facing a disaster. [Flood](../_Pantheon/G_Flood) and [Ending](../_Pantheon/G_Ending) were working together to end the age of balance. Tiamat was to be raised and all lands united: ten heroes were sent to stop it.

- **Dragonborn:** Pandjed Mahradyllion (Cleric of Balance)
- **Elf:** Ridaro & Mindartis Amakiir (brother and sister) (Sorcerer and Fighter)
- **Dwarf:** Audhild Torunn (Artificer)
- **Gnome:** Frug Nackle (Rogue)
- **Human:** Musharraf Brontes & Maricela Kenta (Paladin of Consistency and Cleric of Time)
- **Halfling:** Gynnie Greenleaf (Wizard)
- **Half-Orc:** Cagak (Paladin of Blood)
- **Tiefling:** Mystbringer (Sekhmet Azarra) (Warlock)

They were supposed to stop the awakening and calling of Tiamat, but could not prevent it. Most of them died in the attempt. Ridaro, Audhild, and Mystbringer still stood when the ritual was nearing completion.

Ridaro, seeing that they were going to fail, at the last moment, betrayed her party and completed the ritual herself. It granted her the wish.

She used it, intending to save the world and her party and to give them another shot at saving life, but instead entered the world into a new age. She woke up in the midst of nothing but children. The world was whole and undestroyed, but all adults were gone. The children all remembered a plague killing everyone. Balance was nothing but a tiny goddess and Fluidity was great in power. 

Ridaro changed her name to Nereina and her appearance to be much younger. She told the oldest two elven brothers the story of how Ridaro Amakiir, their forefather, had saved the world from ending but hadn't been able to prevent the plague. 

Ever since she has been trying to correct what she perceives as her mistake. She thinks she destroyed the world and the current world is a fake.

The dragon wars around 382 were the consequence of her first attempt at raising Tiamat.

It took almost 400 years to gain alliance with five adult chromatic dragons and goad or trick them into attempting the ritual. 

The ritual was stopped right before Tiamat could grant the wish.

- **Human:** Eshan of Jinn (Cleric)
- **Elf:** Umilythe Tortris (Wizard)
- **Tiefling:** Quest (Miloslava Baker) â†’ Orange skinned Tiefling with red glowing eyes and ram like curved horns (Warlock of Asmodeus)
- **Dwarfs:** Oloric & Torbekh Travak (Soldier and Barbarian, brothers)
- **Human:** Anatelu Aelis (Rogue)

Now Ridaro is 743 years old and this may be her last shot. She is creating chromatic dragons in a desperate last attempt.
