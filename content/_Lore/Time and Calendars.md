Orijin's world (or at least most of this continent) knows a twelve-month calendar. 

Every month has 29 days, the amount of days it takes the guide star to complete a color cycle. 

The Guide Star is a bright light seen in the northern sky on most nights. Its brightness and color oscillates visibly to the human (and better) eye. From dim and reddish orange to bright white. A month starts at the dimmest of the star. The 15th is the brightest, after which the brightness of the month subsides into a new one.

So, yes, technically these are not months at all, but starths :)

Lots of the 1st's and 15th's are claimed by some type of celebratory occasion. 

Weeks are 7 days long. The 15th of a month (also called brightstar) is not part of any week. Traditionally it's a time-off day.
