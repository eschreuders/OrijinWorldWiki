[Ridaro Amakiir](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FP_Nereina%20Amakiir) desperately wants to gain a wish or (if all else fails), end this age. 

Tiamat is to be raised to induce a Wish.
The goal of the wish is to reset the world and enter a new time of balance starting right before the beginning of the counting of this age.

She is using the orthodox temple of Balance for her lackeys.

### Deities:

[Knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Knowledge) has noticed elves trying to break into a few of his sanctuaries. His anima are directed at Manaia to seek out clues. One of his most inportant disciples is lost to him and this is a concern. He tries contacting her brother.

[Fluidity](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Fluidity) had noticed her god essence being stolen and taken to the dragon lab in Drenith and she is furious. She couldn't prevent it from being used to hatch a dragon, so now she is even more furious. No-one fucks over the reigning goddess of all. THe essence seems to have moved to Manaia, so she sends her champion after it.

[The Lost One](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_The%20Lost%20One) has noticed quite some of his Manaian disciples disappearing. The souls are stolen. As a protector of these people, he set out a signal to his deepest believing champion: which happened to be a giant, Storm.

### Things Ridaro does:

Finding the right god essence to grow up dragons fast: Fluidity for Drenith Blue, Flood for Marsh Black.

Using demon souls and souls of criminals to create the necessary candles

Using Orthodox Balance acolytes to do her dirty work

Preventing the temple from realizing she has infiltrated the sect. (some of them are high-ranking members of the Balance temple)

Trym, Draven and Julio have stopped her plans with the black dragon. She now is trying to kill them.
