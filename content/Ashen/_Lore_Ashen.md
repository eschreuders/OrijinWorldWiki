## Heart of Fire

***Taking Tosh Campaign Lore** - The lands now called Ashen were the location of the Final Battle of the Last Age of Balance. (The year 0 A.B) Here it was that [Flood's](../_Pantheon/G_Flood.md) and [Ending's](../_Pantheon/G_Ending.md) champions attempted to raise Tiamat and finish the world.*

No-one quite remembers what used to be here, but nowadays it is a hot, molten wasteland with lava pools and a scorching sun. Two twin-dragons used to live here and have certainly played their part in shaping it. One was confirmed to be destroyed during the second attempt to raise Tiamat in the year 382 AB. The other hasn't been seen since, however eruptions and earthquakes in the area are still being attributed to him. 

Most people avoid this place even if it adds weeks to their journey. Only some, daring or desperate enough, go in. They hope to find ancient magic, priceless knowledge or simply dragon hoard. As for living here: if there's no other place in the world left for you to go (except for maybe Orijin's grave), this is where you might hide.

The Dwarves of [Greywall](../Grey%20Empire/_Lore_Grey_Empire.md) have tasked themselves with keeping an eye on Ashen. They always keep themselves prepared in case the dragon decides to make a comeback.

Many mining companies take the risk of being on the Mountain-Side Ashen border, because of the fine ores and gems found in the area. Whatever mines arenâ€™t owned by Dwarven houses, are being exploited by privately-owned mining companies. Competition is fierce and sometimes murderous. Greywall naturally tries to be the main investor.

On the desert side, a few ancient Orc clans remain. They pride themselves with surviving in the harsh conditions and view the dragons as champions of [Blood](../_Pantheon/G_Blood.md). 

**Main Gods:** [Blood](../_Pantheon/G_Blood.md), [The Lost One](../_Pantheon/G_The%20Lost%20One.md), [Ending](../_Pantheon/G_Ending.md)
