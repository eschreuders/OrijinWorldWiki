The Manaia Harbor is reached by passing through an opening in the tower barrier. On both sides of this river are immense statues of an elven woman (the nameless guardians). One holds a sword and a lantern. One holds a shield and an orb. This passage and sidearm of the river has been cut through a mountain and the remaining rock has been shaped into these ladies.

A valley is hollowed out and filled with water. The docks are three tiers into the rest of the city.
