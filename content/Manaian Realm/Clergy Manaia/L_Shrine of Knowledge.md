On the second tier of the Manaia harbor lies a small painters' supplies store. All sorts of inks, paints and tools for crafting. The owner, a n older half Orc/half elf named [Delsaran of Rantii](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FP_Delsaran%20of%20Rantii) has an atelier in the back. He looks like a greenish, bigger, burlier green elf with small tusks (or a very handsome orc) His sleek, grey hair is tied back, thinning a bit op top.

Several easles with landscapes of the mountainsides, one of the metallic guards and even some portraits of elves.  

A slightly yellowed and old painting in the the middle of the back wall back depicts an old, scarred and rugged looking orc with one wooden leg and a much smaller, beautiful, brown haired elf smiling and holding each other's hands. There's also a young adult version of Delsaran, a greenish elf girl with tiny tusks and another Orcish lady with longer ears and a slightly thinner build. 

Behind the large protrait, it a small alcove with the symbol of knowledge painted on the wall.
