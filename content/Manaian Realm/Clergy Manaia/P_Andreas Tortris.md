Young Elven man with brown, wavy hair. Looks quite a bit like his mother, [Umilythe Tortris](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMage%20Quarter%2FP_Umilythe%20Tortris) His age is 159. His parents (father: ==Aluin Damartriir==) lived together in the capital for the first few years of his life. 

They then separated over religious differences. Umilythe adventured around the great river and Andreas was raised at first by his father and, starting at the age of 100, traveled the world like his mother had done. 

He gathers law from all kinds of countries, values the belief of different cultures and likes to see their differences when applying justice. These last twenty years he has studied at the [School of Law and Balance](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FL_School%20of%20Law%20and%20Balance).

Since his adulthood he and his mother have gotten back in touch.

Disposition: proper and somewhat serious. Curious towards strangers.
