#location #balance #clergymanaia #manaiacity 

Past the gate of balance lies the second half of the mountain. Scattered throughout is a number of abbeys, shrines and smaller temples, some from ages past.

The buildings are connected by simple teleportation stones. Walking to a shrine earns you the ability to walk there the next time. The summit teleport is only granted to the highest of priests. The very summit is a carved out stature of Balance herself, some say in as much as three ages past. 

#### Daia'Vas (Temple Base)
Here is a vast cloyster and other houses surrounding it. Some foresters in service of the temple live here, pilgrims and people serving the government. 

##### Arch
The square in the middle has a beautiful arch. In it a crack between dimensions has opened. The Elves haven't found a way in, but sometimes agents come through. 

One intricately carved agent with two pairs of wings stays near the gate. It checks that no-one tampers with it. They say the are "Watching for Balance." His name is ==One==.
==Violu Karilandir==, brown haired elf with bronze circlet and a few freckles around the nose takes notes for the mage tower.

**Barracks of the kight Order of Balance:** Captain ==Habritianus Denbal==. (the older, full elf, short brown hair, no humor)

##### Shops

**Carpenters:** ==Madeline and Jean Deupris==

#### Seat of government

Two paladins guard every entrance to the government building: blackguard stat block

#### Four Corner Temple
A shrine remembering Balance uniting the Four desires: Blood, Ending, Knowledge and Prosperity. The temple is built in cross-shape with one of the desires in each space left out. In the middle is a statue of Balance, giving grace.

Priest: ==**Hazir Jirasis**==, older elf with a shaved head, one bad leg and a cane.

Quest: Lately the statue has started to shed a tear every now and then. Hazir has been wiping them away. They are blood.
Legends of balance statues crying have been told. Always it was because of grave injustice being committed in her name. 

#### Son of Balance Shrine
The story of Balance casting her grief and creating The Lost One carved out in marble statues in the middle. The back wall is a mural of a forest. Many tiny lights float across the wall. Several god essences are behind the mural.

Priest: ==**Jeras Amakiir**==. 

Quest: Lights have been going out as of late. Priest has seen it in the poorer neighborhood of town. The orphans are gone. He would have the source found and stopped. 

==Wolf== A very ragged, thin looking elf. Follower of the lost one, travels the mountain.
He has an old, self drawn map of a balance catacomb.

#### Six Sibling Shrines

**Stone Forest** Area before entering the six sibling shrines. Vast area with stone trees. The roots arch up from the rocky ground high in the air and the tree trunks start about 100 feet above ground. The trees themselves remind the most of weeping willows, long plumes of leaves almost touching the grounds and creating curtains in between the tree roots. 

There is a drop in the land, a bowl among the stone arches. A village is in the stone trees, high up. Some bridges are built between them, seamlessly melting with the tree trunks. The trees used to be rock face, On the branches high up, actual trees are forming the foliage.

Centaurs live in the tops of the trees. Speak Sylvan. Their holy mission of balance is to keep the land sharks in check and help people get passage through the stone forest.


#### Legend of the stone forest
A champion of balance, Manaii, knew that protection would be needed, or in the end the creatures would devour the land. She shattered one of Balance's tokens of power high up over the land. Where the dust fell, trees sprouted from the ground. The final shard was given to the centaurs as a token of power and protection.

Legend goes that the land sharks and other creatures actually formed the landscape after that. They burrowed so much over the centuries that, in combination with the erosion of the wind, the stone arches and pillars were formed. They couldn't touch the divine trees though.

The appearance of land sharks has increased over the last few years, like Balanceâ€™s presence is fading from the mountain.

**Inhabitants:** a group of centaurs have a village here. 
**Leader:** ==Ironshaft==. Dark red fur and braided beard. Carries spears and a tower shield. 

**Leader:** Janesh Ironshaft

**Druids:** Mirella Primvale, Havis Primvale

All of the Aspects have interconnected shrines along the mountainside. A path along a stream with stairs and bridges connects them.

##### Flood 
Pool of water with a cracked altar. On the bottom of the pool is a lot of rubble. On the altar sits an ancient and crackled mummy (Flood's last champion, ==Hathmin Fairdell==)
crosslegged with cupped hands, grinning ominously. The hollow eyes have a spark in them, but only if you look at them sideways.

**Priest:** ==**Adalaida**==, a merfolk woman, green hair wover with seaweed and blue skin. Necklaces made out of shells. Worships Flood because she sees the value of his power. 

The bottom of the great river and certain coasts grows stale without regular storms and floods. Her people are having to migrate downriver.

**Quest:** Alida is looking for Flood's power. She will grant great treasure to those who can bring it back to one of his temples. 



##### Fluidity
Pool of water, but here a circle of columns still stands. The altar in the middle is a basin of water. (teleport to the grand temple at the great river. If you offer here it returns something. Usually a cat.) At least thirty cats live in the area. 

**Priest**: ==Davide Mareos==, half-elf with a short brown beard , redbrown skin and yellow eyes. Has multiple small scars in his face and on other bare skin. A scarred over brand in his neck. Acolyte, washed ashore one day.

**Quest:** Bring Fluidity's essence to the basin. Grants teleport to the great temple for free and a bag of 1500 platinum.

##### Spark
A 60 feet, gravity defying steel rod sticks from the earth. Stone slabs with intricate carvings are placed around it.

**Priest:** ==Xavia Altwelt==, human with red braids and freckles on brown skin. Several scars on her arms and face. Green eyes.  

Quest: do her a favor and do a long rest in the time of one hour. (1/8) she travels the mountain regularly and has noticed a change in the forests and creatures. Some are changing structure, powdery, greying. The killing of a feywild settlement has opened rifts to the shadowfell. Give peace to the souls lost.


#### The Summit
Carved out statue of Balance, at least as big as the sisters of old near the canal. She holds the scales and has an open palm raised to the heavens. In it there's always a divine light burning. In times past the light could be seen all the way near Tosh as a star. Now Balance has only a few God essences, so it mainly is seen in Manaia itself.

Below the statue is a network of halls and caverns, carved out of the rock.
