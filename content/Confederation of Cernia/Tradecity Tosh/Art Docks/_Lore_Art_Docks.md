The art docks are the gold and silver docks south-east of town. They are separated from the rest of the city by a magically constructed fence called: the fence.  

The art docks are where ships arrive that have sailed down [the Surge](../../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/_Lore_Tosh_Manaia_Trade_Route.md). The silver docks are where artwork is stored, the gold docks have special measures taken to store magical items.

Outside the fence are the dock offices where any paperwork is filed and permits are handles. Right next to these lie the the [Golden Dog offices](../../../_Lore/O_Golden%20Dogs.md), Tosh's postal office.

Another landmark is the gigantic building of the **Labs of Lore**, a facility of the Mage Tower where magic items are made and fixed.
