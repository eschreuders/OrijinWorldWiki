Tellis is a dark green scaled dragonborn. Very tall and thin, somewhat bent over. His head fits right in between two wooden beams above his counter at the [Gold 'n Gems](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FSmall%20Trader%20District%2FL_Gold'n%20Gems). 

Very good at knowing gems.

Disposition: Afraid to be robbed or cheated, but can't help loving shiny things.
