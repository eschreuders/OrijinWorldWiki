Mucky quarter has been the name for the slums near Moat Muck. Centuries ago the Tradecity Tosh had been surrounded by a single wall and a wide moat (supplied by the great river). In an attempt to keep out the less lucky citizens that were settling outside the city walls and dumping their trash in the moat, a second, lower wall was raised. A secondary moat was also dug a fair distance away.

This one now serves as an open sewer for the slums. Hence Moat Muck and Mucky Quarter. Residents are often referred to as the Muckies.

The town itself has no real power in the slums. It is mostly ruled by a citizen’s watch and a few gangs.

## **Landmarks**  

### **Little gate:** 
Anyone wanting to pass the toll house first has to pass the guards here. They are under strict orders not to let any funny business in. Generally no-one from mucky quarter passes.

### **Guard house:** 
Little gate watch is stationed here Leader: [Captain Denbal](../../Confederation%20of%20Cernia/Tradecity%20Tosh/Muckies/P_Captain%20Denbal.md)

### **Wash Ponds:** 
People gather here to do their laundry. Takes water from the clean Gleamy moat. They are guarded by civilians to make sure no-one makes it filthy.

### **Gloomy greenery and Gossip greenery.** 
The fields near the wash ponds where clothes are left to dry. The old wives gossip while everything is drying. Especially near the populated gossip greenery area.

### **Clock stable:** 
Clock gate’s stable. Older than the slums. Merchants and mercenaries from out of town stable their horses here.

### **Old oak:** 
Ancient oak left over from the days where the city was contained in the walls. General landmark. Often a meeting place. Also a great location for parties, duels and other ceremonies.

### **Big square:** 
At least... it’s big compared to the alleyways and narrow roads of Mucky quarter. Some of the nicer establishments border it.

### **Old graveyard:** 
Used to be far outside the city walls. Not anymore.

### **Skirts:** 
Somewhere between the contested lands and the actual houses of the mucky quarter. The skirts are kind of an in between. Rickety, leaky homes. No windows, maybe a door...

### **Contested lands:** 
The real bad shacks and slums were never meant to pass Moat Muck. But they did. And now there’s lots of tension between the contested lands and the forgotten farmlands.

### **Forgotten Farmlands:** 
Whatever is left of the farms once surrounding Tradecity Tosh. The farmers try to stand their ground while the slums enclose on their lands. Have created their own militia since the guard has no funds to protect them.

### **Nowhere homes:** 
People living here are really out of luck. Fugitives, outlaws and poor souls live in tents, cardboard and rotten wood plank homes. The only status you may ever have here is that of a successful gang member.
