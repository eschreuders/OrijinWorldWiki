#person #shopowner #muckies #tradecitytosh #fluidity 

Owner of Sanaza Scribery, the office for all things involving paperwork in the mucky quarter of Tosh.

Human man with unusually blue eyes and somewhat pale, blueish skin. Has studied law in Fahlia and went to the muckies to serve a good cause and escape some skeletons in the closet.

Disposition: Very correct.
