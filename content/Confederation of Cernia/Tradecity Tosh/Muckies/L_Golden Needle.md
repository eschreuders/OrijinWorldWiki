Clothiers. Make plain, practical clothing for an affordable price. Also deal in old cloth.

In the back room there's a secret shrine to [consistency](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Pantheon%2FG_Consistency), run by [Naima Men](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FP_Naima%20Men).
