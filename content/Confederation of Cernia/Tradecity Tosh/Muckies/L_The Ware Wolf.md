Pawn shop. Not the only one in town, but most definitely one of the more well known.

Used to be a pawn shop for the cult of Lolth, a gang of thieves and assassins for hire. The cult was broken up and the leaders destroyed by [Vinke Hoot](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Z_Player%20Characters%2FPC_Vinke%20Hoot), [Trym Topplehill](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Z_Player%20Characters%2FPC_Trym%20Topplehill) and [Draven](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Z_Player%20Characters%2FPC_Draven)

Doorman: [Barbras](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMuckies%2FP_Barbras)
