Small community of houses centered around a courtyard with rose garden. Only widows and unwed women are allowed to live here. They look out for each other. 

Openly this community belongs to [Prosperity](o../../_Pantheon/G_Prosperity.md) like the rest of inner city Tosh. Secretly the ladies believe in [Knowledge](../../_Pantheon/G_Knowledge.md), the god of understanding and completeness.

The shrine is located in the kitchen of [Pauline Welsh](../../Confederation%20of%20Cernia/Tradecity%20Tosh/Craftman's%20Street/P_Pauline%20Welsh.md).
