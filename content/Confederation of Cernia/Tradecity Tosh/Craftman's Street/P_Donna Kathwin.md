#person #tradecitytosh #craftmansstreet #knowledge #commoner 

Human woman, shrouded in blankets, 92 years old. Is blind with long white hair that touches the ground. She usually sits in front of her house in [Hag's Corner](../../Confederation%20of%20Cernia/Tradecity%20Tosh/Craftman's%20Street/L_Hags%20Corner.md) mumbling in a language no one knows. Sometimes it's almost arcane.

Can induce visions from [Knowledge](../../_Pantheon/G_Knowledge.md).

Disposition: absent. Intense when having a vision.
