## City of Trade

Tradecity Tosh, or just 'Tosh' for short, is The most upriver city in Cernia. They are the only ones whom [Manaia](../../Manaian%20Realm/Clergy%20Manaia/_Lore_Clergy_Manaia.md) will trade with and therefore can make great profit off of elvish merchandise and magic items. Within the [Confederation of Cernia](../_Lore_Cernia.md), Tosh is definitely the richest and it has quite some political influence over the river as a whole. Most downriver cities depend at least partly on exotic goods coming from Tosh. 

Their political advantage with the elves, isolated location and a non-aggressive disposition (why fight someone if you can trade with them) make sure Tosh has relatively little to fear. 

There is the one green dragon, Enrisa, to the north, but even though she has boasted about owning Tosh, she somehow leaves the city itself alone.

Tosh looks to the Elven capital when it comes to art and fashion. The architecture of the inner city is a human, quickly built version of elvish ethereal luxury. Toshians say it is uniquely artful. Others might say it looks tacky. 

After the dragon wars in 382 AB and the unrest in Fahlia, there was a lot of migration to the city and within only a few decades, it tripled its population. The city outside the walls is now at least as big as the inner city and much more colorful and diverse.

The 'true Toshians' as they call themselves, live within the old city walls and make sure no rabble gets in without an official writ. The city is governed by a council of the most wealthy and influential traders. A seat on this council grants one the title Sir Trader. Getting one usually involves a large sum of money and a bit of ruthless political maneuvering. A seat on the council also grants one more trading rights and influence all around. 

## Skeletons in the Closet

A somewhat embarrassing feature of Tosh is that the dead won't always stay dead. Around the year 440AB a necromancer wrecked havoc in the area until they were stopped by a party of adventurers. Some of the side effects are still causing undead to rise every now and then. If you ask the people of Tosh, they kind of beat around the bush. They seem to prefer to deny that they might once be subject to that. 

**Population**: Inner city is mostly human with some half-elves and elves. Outside the walls anything goes. 

**Gods:** [Prosperity](../../_Pantheon/G_Prosperity.md) within the walls and [Fluidity](../../_Pantheon/G_Fluidity.md) outside the walls. There are rumored secret shrines to [Knowledge](../../_Pantheon/G_Knowledge.md) and [Consistency](../../_Pantheon/G_Consistency.md).
