Also known as the final boss of [Blacktower Hamlet](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/_Lore_Blacktower_Hamlet.md). She used to be the violin teacher (and protector) of [Draven's](../../_Player%20Characters/PC_Draven%20von%20Goldford%20et%20dLamonas.md) sister Lysiris. When Lysyris married into the Bernouilli family and was safely away from the von Maggados family, Katharina felt she could pursue her own interests. She and Draven got married.

It is mostly Katharina who takes care of the daily business of the town and the rebuild of Blacktower's main landmark. People don't like to get on her bad side. Especially not since she catapulted a deceitful contractor out of town by striking an ear-piercing c-minor.

Disposition: Fiery and determined. Does not take bullshit, but has a kind side as well.
