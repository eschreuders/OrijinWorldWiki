Now a guard to the small town of [Blacktower](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/_Lore_Blacktower_Hamlet.md). Little full-ogre brother of [Barbras](../Tradecity%20Tosh/Muckies/P_Barbras.md).

On a job for The Web, he was defeated and afterwards during the final showdown at the web, recruited instead of killed by [Draven](../../_Player%20Characters/PC_Draven%20von%20Goldford%20et%20dLamonas.md) as a guard his new town.

Huge Ogre, not very smart. Just tell him what to smash. Has a love for little trinkets.
