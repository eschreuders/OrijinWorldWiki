## Town on the Rise
Blacktower hamlet is a village on the edge of The Great River with surrounding forest and fishing waters. Formally it falls under the jurisdiction of [Tradecity Tosh](../Tradecity%20Tosh/_Lore_Tradecity_Tosh.md).

In ages past there used to be a tall tower made of black stone where the village lord would live. It is unknown which family used to own this village. The oldest and only records from 441 AD state that the owner at that time had gone mad, was accused of necromancy and was destroyed by an adventuring party hired by the city of Tosh. The tower fell to rubble and all records of the family were erased by an unknown cause.

After that the hamlet declined and decreased to the size of a few fishermen and farmer families. They would take turns providing a mayor. The seat on the Toshian Trader council remained empty, people saying it was cursed.

In the year 583 AB the deeds of the village (and accompanying council seat and Trader title) were bought by a new trader in town: [Draven von Goldford et d'Lamonas](../../_Player%20Characters/PC_Draven%20von%20Goldford%20et%20dLamonas.md). Rumor has it that he did [Trader Pardran Goldsooth](../Tradecity%20Tosh/P_Pardran%20Goldsooth.md) a special favor, who then covered part of the costs.

While adventuring, he left the day to day business to the mayor and later on the development of the village was placed in the hands of his wife [Katharina](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/P_Katharina%20von%20Goldford%20et%20dLamonas.md). The Lamonas family aimed to make the trade route along the river easier and to maintain the road for a small toll.

Over time the town has grown as various new businesses and the construction work to restore the tower have attracted more people. There is also some tourism in the area as a zoo has just opened up. 

Others visit to see the many normally 'evil' creatures that live together with the villagers. There is the Kobold guard protecting Milady Trader Katharina and the village. (some say they have their own city underneath the tower) There is also the legendary 'squid' innkeep and the [Ogre](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/P_Git.md) town guard... and do not forget the Feathered Friend zoo with its owlbear family!

- **Tavern/inn \<Insert name\>"** Run by a Flumph called Murphy (originally a Feathered Friend rescue) and a somewhat mysterious girl called Falia with a long, thick braid and suspiciously good knife juggling abilities.
- **Dock 3 Construction Contracts:** regional office of the legendary Dock 3 hired hands, wings and claws. They have opened a small office in town to oversee the hired construction workers. While they're there, they also facilitate low level adventuring missions into the woods.
- **The Feathered Friend:** a mystical creature rescue agency run by [Kevin Ladall](P_Kevin%20Ladall). It is part zoo, part rescue. It used to be a small store on the outskirts of Tosh, but Draven invited Ladall to use the wide open space of Blacktower's outskirts to realize Kevin's dream of being able to support any magical creature's needs.
