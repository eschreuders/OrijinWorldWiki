Rescue for all kinds of magical pets and companions. [Owner Kevin Ladall](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/P_Kevin%20Ladall) finds sick and rejected creatures, nurses them back to health and finds suitable new homes for them if they want. Fees are for adoption and no creature goes without consent. Intelligent creatures only stay as long as they want. An optional fee of 200gp applies (which the creature asks of his new companion as a compensation for the rescue) 

This used to be a small store on the outskirts of [Tradecity Tosh](../Tradecity%20Tosh/_Lore_Tradecity_Tosh.md). The owner was offered an opportunity to expand and harbor bigger and more dangerous creatures in [Blacktower](../Blacktower%20Hamlet/_Lore_Blacktower_Hamlet.md) and took the bait.
