## The Rebellious Sister

Minport is the main town along the banks of the small sister lake. It used to be part of the [Three Sister Kingdom](../../Three%20Sister%20Kingdom/_Lore_Three_Sister_Kingdom.md). The Three Sister Kingdom still considers Minport part of their country in their historic documentation. (after all, they're not called THREE sister kingdom for nothing) 

Fortunately the Three Sister Kingdom has enough rivalry with the [Orcish nomads](../../Orcish%20Nomads/_Lore_Orcish_Nomads.md) and Daianna that they don't feel like starting a conflict with Cernia as well.

Minport is a prosperous fishing and trading town. It is not nearly as big and rich as Fahlia or Tosh, but is key in the greater picture of world politics. Whoever holds Minport, has their ships ruling the Small Sister Lake.
