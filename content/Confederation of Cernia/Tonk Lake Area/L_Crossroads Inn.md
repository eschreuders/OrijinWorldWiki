Followers of [Consistency](../../_Pantheon/G_Consistency.md) can go on a pilgrimage to [Jinn monastery](../Tonk%20Lake%20Area/L_Jinn%20Monastery.md). The crossroads inn is the last bit of civilization before the last part of this journey: three weeks of a barefoot walk through lands that become more and more dry and warm.
