## The Secret Path

South of [Fahlia](../Bulwark%20Fahlia/_Lore_Bulwark_Fahlia.md) the eastern branch of the great river ends in what is called Tonk Lake. Tonk lake’s surface is about 1800 km2 and Downtonk another 800km2 (Scale: IJsselmeer+Markermeer are 1800km2)

The land around the lake is hilly and towards the south these hills get larger and harder to climb until the [Orcish territories](../../Orcish%20Nomads/_Lore_Orcish_Nomads.md) are reached, roughly a month of travel to the south. Around the lakes is a temperate climate, with more rain and downpours the more south a traveler will go.

Tonk lake itself is well known for a very specific kind of carp: the **tonkfish**. It is recognizable by its silver scaled back and a darker black stripe along its flanks. It is widely known as a delicacy and therefore transported and made into all sorts of products. Tonkfish ale, Tonkfish sauce and Tonkfish cookies are just a few examples.

The fishing and trade make the towns around this lake fairly prosperous.

Most people in this area worship [Consistency](../.._Pantheon/G_Consistency.md), much like the majority of Fahlia. Other commonly seen gods are [Fluidity](../../_Pantheon/G_Fluidity.md) (Muckies in Tosh and Three Sister Kingdom), [Blood](../../_Pantheon/G_Blood.md) (Orc influences), [Prosperity](../../_Pantheon/G_Prosperity.md) (Tosh influences) and [Knowledge](../../_Pabtheo/G_Knowledge.md) (Influences from beyond the Orcish lands, pretty rare).

Some say **Quathwendyl** the legendary sea serpent lives in Tonk lake. Others say this is just an old wive’s tale and people should drink less.
