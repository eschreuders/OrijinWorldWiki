## The Route To Be
Two branches of the Great River connect Manaia to Tradecity Tosh. The southern one (the Surge) is way too rapid to travel upstream. The northern one (Maiana Flow) is not quite as placid as near Fahlia, but one can sail a fisherboat up there when the winds allow.

It is the Surge that is used by expert sailors with special boats for high-end express deliveries. The Manaia flow is used for day-to-day trade.

Creatures rumored to live here are sea serpents, elementals and every now and then a ghost story about a roc is shared. Some people talk of dragon sightings, but it has not happened in a while.
