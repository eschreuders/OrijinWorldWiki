Or so they call themselves. They looks somewhat like a fish in humanoid form, very exquisite clothing adorned with embroidery and all sorts of sparkle.

These are two Marid lost on the material plane, trying to find their [mother's pet elemental (Flo)](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Nymphae%20and%20Flo.md) in the great river. They try to employ anyone to fix it or they'll break their ship.
