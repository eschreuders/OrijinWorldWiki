## Greatest House on the River (As Proclaimed by the Owner)

Largest temple of Fluidity along the great river. It's a series of aquaducts and bassins built into a hillside. Gardens are a part of it. 

A couple of ages back it used to belong to [Flood](../../_Pantheon/G_Flood.md). Since then the Fluidity followers have spruced it up. Flowers, trees and animals can be seen around the temple complex. Remarkable is the number of cats living here.

#### Entrance
Entrance to the temple grounds is exclusive for true believers. Invitation-only. Fluidity is a Goddess who easily shifts moods. They who displeased her can be seen splurted out by one of the many waterfalls into the great river.

#### Hierarchy
There is a group of lead priests (17), but the ultimate ruler of this temple is a Burmese cat. There are about 90 cats in the temple complex and all their needs are catered to. Around 250 regular priests keep things running.
