Drunken old man, grey beard, grey hair. Smells of old ale. Thick knuckles, red with inflammation. Sits in [Shanty's](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Shanty.md) square under the dais a lot.

50 years ago when he was a young lad, a dragon made an emergency landing right in the middle of town. It crashed into some buildings and tore a few scales off, but apart from a few big gashes and a nasty cough, the beast was fine. It even spoke with him, asked about the weather and the fishing. Tasted tome ale. Then he flew off, shiny silver in the afternoon sun.

Disposition: Drunken, no one tends to believe his stories.
