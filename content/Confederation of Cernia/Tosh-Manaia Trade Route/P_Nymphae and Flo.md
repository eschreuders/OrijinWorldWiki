Marid woman with two sons, [Hydros and Aquas](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Hydros%20and%20Aquas.md). The two always cause mischief and had gotten her pet elemental Flo lost on the material plane. She banished them there to find the poor thing.

Unfortunately one was banished back and the other fled back, both being quite worse for wear. In the end she had to go back and get Flo by herself..

Marid, slightly middle aged looking woman. Blue skin, dark blue and silver hair, very elaborately dressed in maroon silk. Big earrings with sapphires. 

Disposition: demanding, convinced her sons need a lesson.


**Flo**: Small water elemental mixed in with dark blue sparkly gems. It's shy of most people.
