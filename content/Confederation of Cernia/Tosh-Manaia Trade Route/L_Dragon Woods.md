## Which Dragon?

Most people think the woods are named after the tiny rainbow critters at [Faerie Lake](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Faerie%20Lake.md).

Some know that there is a rich history of other dragon sightings in this area: shimmering scales speeding past the sun, a large shadow looming over the trees. The stories are old, though. Who knows how true they are?
