## Like a Village from a Song

Village about a day travel from the city of [Tosh](../Tradecity%20Tosh/_Lore_Tradecity_Tosh.md). Part fishing town, part town of rabble. You can get a bad ale here, basic supplies and there's sea serpent scales. 

#### Dragon Daise 
There's a small clearing in the village used for the fishing market. In it is a small dais with roof shingles made out of huge, greyish scales (polishing will make them gleam silver). Some say it's from an enormous serpent. Others say a huge dragon landed here 50 years ago or so.

[Old Fisher Dan](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Old%20Fisher%20Dan.md) will drunkenly tell you the dragon tried to strike up conversation and wanted to taste his ale.

#### Agatha's Shed
Literally the shed of a beefy woman named [Agatha](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Agatha%20Nellis.md). Located near the docks and has general supplies to fix things and some trinkets and smoked fish. General opinion is that she has the unofficial leadership.

Near the docks the town carpenter has a shop:  [Bennett Fardas](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Bennett%20Fardas.md)

#### The Surfer's Couch 
There's a man here that likes to skid across the river waves with nothing but a simple sail attached to a narrow raft. His name is [Surfer Johnson](o../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Surfer%20Johnson.md). He rents out his back room and a bench to travelers who need rest.

#### Fairy Dragons
A bunch of Fairy dragons fled from [Faerie Lake](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Faerie%20Lake.md) have set up camp near town. They are causing all sorts of mischief, but are starting to form a wary alliance with the townspeople.
