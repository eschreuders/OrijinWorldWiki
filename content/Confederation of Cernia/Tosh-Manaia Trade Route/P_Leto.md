Leto was once a storm giant, looking for her brother, Storm. The music loving gentle giant had gotten a mountain boulder on his head and ever since has a tendency to wander. He is looking for a supposed third sibling: his lost brother.

The storm giants are part of the Cumulus empire at Cloudpeak (near Drenith). Leto has gone to find Storm to get him to fight an evil uncle who has cursed their father and her.

Leto has fallen to the illness and is now at the end of her life. Still wanting to find Storm, she has taken up residence near [Faerie Lake](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Faerie%20Lake.md), turning into a thunderstorm and chasing the tiny dragons away.

Luckily she managed to convince a party of adventurers to help her find her brother.
