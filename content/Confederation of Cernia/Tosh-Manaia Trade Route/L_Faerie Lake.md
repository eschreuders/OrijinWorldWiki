A lake said to house a bunch of faerie dragons. Adventurers often go there to admire the creatures and offer them a small gem. It is said such an offering will bring a blessing from [Prosperity](../../_Pantheon/G_Prosperity.md) The gems are glittering on the bottom of the lake.

Recently a [storm](../Tosh%-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/P_Leto.md) has gathered above the lake having caused the dragons to take refuge in [Shanty](../Tosh%-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Shanty.md).
