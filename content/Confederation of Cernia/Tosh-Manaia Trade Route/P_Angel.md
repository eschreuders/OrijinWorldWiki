Lady in a lavish white satin dress with many layers and huge white feathers (roc). She wears a mask and has intricately pinned up white hair. Her hands are gloved. No skin is showing at all. Behind the mask her eyes are solid golden. No pupils or whites.

She runs [Angel's](../Tosh-Manaia%20Trade%20Route/L_Angels.md), a resort surrounded by a magic barrier weaved on top of an old marble construction embedded in the ground. Its magic contains a spell that holds the ones crossing in to never share what happened within the walls outside of them. (If anyone should do so, it is said an angel comes to punish them.)
