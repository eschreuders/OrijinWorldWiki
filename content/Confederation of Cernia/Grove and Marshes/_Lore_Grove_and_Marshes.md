## Crossing (on Cernia map)

North Crossing and South Crossing are on the two opposite banks of the Great River. Together they are called Crossing and are an important ferry dock. Since ancient times Crossing has been a place to cross the river to circumvent the dangerous, south bank rain forest.

Large parts of north crossing were destroyed in 583 AB by a band of orcs. Fortunately they were stopped by a party of adventurers.
North crossing has the larger population.
  

#### North Crossing Notable:

- **Consistency shrine**: A temple to consistency is within walls. Graveyard has relatively many recent graves. (young priest: Pasquain Jant)
- **North-West tower**: A watch tower manned by a civil militia. (Fergan, Oain, Cassaji, Wanda, Dront)
- **Barracks**: A nearby barn is converted to a barracks. Trades simple weapons and tools. (Bent Madir)
- **Docks**. House some fishing ships and can accommodate smaller trading vessels. (Or one long ship)
- **Ferry** to south crossing. (Dwarf: Elainee Madir )
- Some newly built farm houses.
- **Wood cutting mill** (water powered) with a workshop. (Deft Paulus Backthrup)

  
#### South Crossing Notable:


- **Mayor’s house**: Gertrut Thebat took over from husband after he died in the first attack. She means business.
- **Weaver**. Carnell Gatweaz

## The Grove


This is the last bit of civilization before the river passes the flooding marshes. The town has grown near a druid circle.
Grove inlets house pirates and outlaws.

#### Notable:

- **Mayor:** Darwan Twonose. Grey at the temples. Rough, grey beard, scar that gives nose a split look. Somewhat good looking clothes, but bit dusty.
- Small, but bustling town. Some farming and fishing.
- No shrine, just a graveyard. Not any God’s name on it.
- **Tinkerer.** Farret Gowan. Artificer retired, from Sprung. Used to work on the waterworks. Spends his retirement figuring out how to stop the poisonous marsh waters. Works with Merner Fault. Developing a filtering system.
- **Tavern:** **Swampy Barrel**, Owner: Priscilla Laghia. Long, long braid. Common room full of people every evening. Two rooms for rent under the rafters.
- **Groundworks office:** Merner Fault. Hobgoblin. Thin man with spectacles on his nose tip. Records the stride of the marshes.
- **Marsh’all’s**: A curious shop selling things sifted from the marshes. Tinka Well. Young girl with double braids and a pink nose, manning the shop for her dad.

## Grove Mooncircle

This ancient druid circle believes the shattered gods are to be found in nature. They defend the land (Lannod) from the marshes (Ocheean). Their efforts keep the Flooding Marshes in check.
 
## Ancient Temple

Final bastion of no-one other than [Flood](../../_Pantheon/G_Flood.md). He is the one claiming the Flooding marshes and trying to eat away the banks of the Great River. In ages past this area was much more volatile. But recently it seems like this god has been given a trickle more power than he used to have. The currents have increased.

## Headscar Territory

Traditional Hobgoblin settlement, north of Makah. Others call it a pirate dive. The Fahlia guards have checked it out: nothing but law-abiding citizens and fishermen.

## The Marsh Wall

An old Fahlia garrison, meant to watch the flooding marshes. Since nothing much has changed there in the past 300 years, it is understaffed and quite crumbly. If you piss off your captain, this is where you're stationed.
