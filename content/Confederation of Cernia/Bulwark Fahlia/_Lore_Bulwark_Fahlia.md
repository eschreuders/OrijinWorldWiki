## The Great River Police
Fahlia is an area along the great river that has been originally inhabited by humans. It is most notably known for its huge fortress that watches over the Great River.

It has been described in songs and myths from ages even before The Last Age of Balance. Most of these songs also mention a dragon with scales of shimmering gold. There used to be a dragon indeed, until it was killed during the second attempted raising of Tiamat in 382 AB.

The resulting gap in power and imbalances between families were said to lead to great civil unrest that would eventually lead to war twenty years later. The fortress still stood, but the city was laid to ashes. 

It was then that the dynasty of Iorio rose to power. The fortress city was rebuilt, the Confederation of Cernia was founded and Fahlia rose to power again. Hobgoblins and Orcs had joined the ranks of this city by then, even though official power stayed in the hands of the humans.

The first Fortress of Fahlia was built during the Last Age of Balance, probably to enforce a toll for traders sailing the Great River. After all, someone was protecting them from pirates and providing them with a harbor to anchor. Policing the Great River, collecting toll and stabilizing the area is Fahliaâ€™s main reason for existence.

Traditionally the land around the city has been disputed and fought over by a number of families for centuries. When the last Age of Balance ended, some stability was found and 42 families clearly distinguished themselves as being able to defend a number of villages and claim the surrounding land. They became known as landowners and could call themselves lords. They swore fealty to yet eleven other families with even greater resources to defend themselves: the high lords. They were the ones supporting, counseling and providing troops for Fahlia and its king.

Inheritance in Fahlia happens from father to son. (one warlord to another) The number of high lords is set by (an unfortunately rather specific) law to be 11 and the number of landowners to 42. Whenever one family dies out, the family to fill the gap is appointed by the king. It is not unusual, though, for high lords to adopt trusted friends or second in commands as sons to ensure keeping things close.

In the meantime, surrounding cities are watching Fahlia closely. After all, they have the greatest military power on the Great River.

**Politics:** The current king, Giovanni Iolio II, has no son and there are many who would like to rise to power. Other than that, trouble is always brewing on the Great River. Fahlia itself is very lawful and governed by strict laws. Most families send at least one child to reinforce its military.
