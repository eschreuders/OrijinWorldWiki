### The 411 AB Ascension Raffle

The year 411 AB was pivotal in the history of the Kingdom of the Three Sisters. This was hugely impacted by the ascension of [[Queen Triana Marqués - Lamiènt]], which was controversial, to say the least.

The inheritance of the kingdom is bound by law; Upon death of the title holder, the heir is the oldest child, bound by the bloodline (so excluding bastards and stepchildren). The king is allowed to abdicate to the next heir in line. This forfeits rights to the title indefinitely.

In 411 AB, the summary of the inheritance went like this:

- King Évrard Marquès dies a natural death (start of 411)
	- King [[Albros Marquès]] inherits, but dies of unknown causes (end of 411). Married to [[Clarisse Marqèus - Hissaire]]
		- Prince [[Emilio Kostellan Marquès]] of [[Mallilos]] is a stepchild and goes missing (end of 411) before any claims can be made.
	- [[Prince Èdouard Marquès]] becomes king after his brother Albros passes, but abdicates a year into his reign (end of 412). His wife [[Queen Triana Marqués - Lamiènt]] inherits the kingdom under the abdication clause with no blood relative remaining.
	- Albros' bastard brother Prince Hadoken Marquès never had any claim due to being a bastard son. He dies of unnateral causes (417) after secession and de facto vassalisation under Fahlia.

Before his death[[The Daianna Campaign|futile war]]n/The Sisteri Republic/History/The Daianna Campaign/The Daianna Campaign|futile war]] to the southern [[City of Daianna]]. This would have been devastating for his duchy and the relations with his northern neighbors. The Queen vowed that Hadoken would fall in line, by force if necessary.

The war to the south proved devastating indeed and a pyrric victory left the kingdom weakened. Unfortunately for the queen, the weakened state coincided with the aftermath of the civil war of Fahlia, preventing her from taking Minport while Minport's greatest ally was on the brink of collapse.

### The Daianna Campaign

The Three Sisteri Conquest of Daianna was an anti-tribal war between the [[Campaign/Taking Tosh/Keth Hogar/Relations/Kingdom of the Three Sisters/Kingdom of the Three Sisters]] versus the [[City of Daianna]]. This war is commonly known in the Three Sisters as 'The Daianna Campaign'.

[[Queen Triana Marqués - Lamiènt]] initiated the campaign shortly after her ascension to the throne. The war was brooding for a longer time, but the potential losses prevented full-out war. The generals always could convince the king to push the colonization agenda and downplaying the raiding issue.

Triana upon ascension had a more pressing reason to go into an agressive invasion; [[Emilio Kostellan Marquès]] escaped her grasp and fled to the [[Unlienh clan]] in the realm of Dajanna.

#### Cause

The lakes are prosperous, but the rising population was not in line with the production rate of food in the region. The high import costs of food threatened the current level of prosperity in the region, as money flows out of the realm, mainly towards [[Drenith]].

This is why around 300 AB, the rulers of Dujelvez region were colonizing to the (south-)west. At first it was a successful venture, but after further expansion the nomadic orcish tribes became hostile with the new residents in their hunting fields. Orcish raids became much more frequent after time went by.
This was especially the case after the church of Nuovo Hermana was finished around 380 AB. This was accompanied with an influx of workers and hence population. The human population and its actions were severely impacting migration patterns of the herds of animals used by the nomads.

The orcs in the mean time saw these developments as well, albeit somewhat later due to their decentralized society. The Unlienh tribe managed to unite most of the tribes due to their might and well-equipped bands. The other tribes at this moment were unaware that the might of this tribe was in large part due to the backing of Unlienh by the [[City of Daianna]].

### Three Sisteri War for Minport

The queen of the [[Campaign/Taking Tosh/Keth Hogar/Relations/Kingdom of the Three Sisters/Kingdom of the Three Sisters]] demanded her [[Small Sister Lake|Duchy of Minport]] back into her realm.

The fortress of Rantii has been overrun and the Sisteri army is undergoing efforts to retake it. This fortress is crucial in holding the western fleets at bay and drive them back.

#### Involvement of the Bulwark of Fahlia

When hearing of the impending landing, The regent of the Duchy of Minport [[Grand Mayor Corniel Du Soverre]] wrote Kinf of Fahlia [[Sigismonte Iorio]] of the situation. The letter contains an Oath of Fealty to Sigismonte, signed by the Grand Mayor. Sigismonte never wrote a reply, as both already knew there was no question on the nature of the response. The relations between the two states have been excellent after years of contributions towards the rebuilding of post-civil war Fahlia. Sigismonte immediately confirmed the pre-written Declaration of Allegiance, making Fahlia a *de jure* participant of the war.

As rebuilding efforts still take a toll on the martial capability of the Fahlian realm, Sigismonte called on his vassals relatively unaffected by the civil war. The majority of these forces originate from [[Campaign/Taking Tosh/Keth Hogar/Relations/Bulwark of Fahlia/Ziddhin/Ziddhin]], the Hobgoblin provinces of the North East.
