God of order & balance, peace, justice & law

Balance was the first god to be created from the [Immaterial gods Ocheean, Lannod and Skye](../_Pantheon/_Lore_Pantheon). Some view her as the only true god for this reason. Most followers, however, place her as a sort of sister-god to the aspects and desires, equal in worth. 

During ages of Balance her influence is clearly seen. During ages of chaos, she is more hands-off. 

During these times her followers take it upon them to create balance (and may sometimes take it to extremes). Fair play is what matters most to her and the peace of all that roam the world. She moves events, people and places in order to tip the scales towards balance in life and death, good and evil. Her goal is ultimate peace. 

She often appears as a lady with a scale. Followers use a white dove as a symbol and consider these animals holy.

**Color**: White

**Symbol**: Triangle on its tip

**Preferred offering:** Confessions of causing imbalance, written in script, burned with incense. Anything of value she'll return in time, though maybe not in the expected way. 

**Essence / Power:** Ooooo
