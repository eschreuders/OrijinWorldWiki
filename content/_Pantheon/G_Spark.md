This god represents Life, Light and Inspiration. Like the spark of a flame which starts a fire, this god is seen by her followers as the start of anything new. 

Some say the light of Spark is in any newborn creature's eyes as they take their first breath. Uplifting and sweet. Spark doesn't judge. 
It is the priests of Spark that travel to battlefields with immunity and will heal either side. 

Spark also has a connection with the Feywild, more so than other gods. Artists and musicians may also choose this deity as an appreciation for their work.

Spark is often depicted as a pixie or a young maiden with fey-like features, flowers woven in her hair. Sometimes she is represented by a single open flame.

**Color**: Yellow

**Symbol**: 8-pointed Star 

**Preferred offering:** a small open flame in which a prayer card is burned. Healing performed in her name.

**Essence / Power:** OOooo
