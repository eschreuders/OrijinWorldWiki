God of Life, War & Bloodshed, and Revenge.

Blood is most often worshiped by people who have a strong cultural tie to battle. He also rules in areas of conflict (on either side) and gives strength to those with a warrior's heart. He may also be followed with those who have strong ties to nature and the cycle of life and death: for example hunters or certain druids. 

Blood takes a very active role. Some say he can be spotted on great battlefields in the shape of a strong warrior leading the front lines. He judges by valor and strength of heart, not by good or evil. 

Those who swear by Blood, will not hesitate to spill blood or risk their life when it is warranted. 

Although most often referred to as male, he may show up as a warrior of any race or gender. He is always wearing rugged hide armor and a gigantic war hammer. Blood is recognized by the names of those who died in his honor, written in blood on every inch of his skin.
