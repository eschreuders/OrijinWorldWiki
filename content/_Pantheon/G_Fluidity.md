Goddess of Adapting, Trickery and Change. 

This age she is the most influential god (and proud of it). Around the Great River she is the main deity, especially in the [Three Sisters Kingdom](../Three%20Sister%20Kingdom/_Lore_Three_Sister_Kingdom.md), [Drenith](../Drenith%20League/_Lore_Drenith_League.md) and on the open waters.

Followers of this deity value a life of change and adventure. They ask for her aid in being able to adapt to whatever circumstances they encounter. Opportunity may be more important to them than morality. What is right, is usually a matter of opinion after all.

She usually appears to her followers as an old lady, a young girl or a spirit cat. She considers all cats to be under her protection.

**Color**: Silver

**Symbol**: Vertical wavy line

**Preferred offering:** Tokens of an adventure, an original prayer.

**Essence / Power:** OOOOO
