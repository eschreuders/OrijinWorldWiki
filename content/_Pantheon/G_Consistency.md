God of Stability, Perseverance and Clarity

The people following Consistency strive to always stay levelheaded when facing hardship. They believe that true happiness and well-being is reached while staying constant under life's pressures.  When all around them changes, these people aim to provide stability. They take a vow to not judge and practice full neutrality.

A subset of these followers record the world's history and save it for the aeons at the monastery of [Jinn](../Confederation%20of%20Cernia/Tonk%20Lake%20Area/L_Jinn%20Monastery). They never interfere, simply observe. 

Others go and provide stability and aid in conflicts or to people in need. They do this in order for these people to, after history has had its course, pick up their lives with grace.

Oak trees have a strong connection to consistency. Messages are often seen in the shape of the land. 
Consistency is mostly pictured as a man with a beard and a shaved head. Some followers shave their heads as well to show their devotion.
