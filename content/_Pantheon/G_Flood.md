God of Destruction, Death and Wrath.

Traditionally this god was revered by either those who wanted to seek protection from nature (particularly water or storms) or those who sought extra power. Some follow him because they understand that sometimes destruction is needed to start anew. 

Since the end of the last age of Balance, he has lost most of the followers to his sister [Fluidity](../_Pantheon/G_Fluidity.md) and some to his former ally [Ending](../_Pantheon/G_Ending.md). 

Rumor has it that he is gaining a small new following and prayers to him are heard more often. The Great River is starting to flow differently.

Flood is an angry and resentful God, to be approached with caution. He is best to avoid when you're on his bad side. But when on his good side, he may grant a lot of power.

Although he is currently not strong enough to show himself on the material plane, Flood can communicate through water. In addition he can communicate telepathically in his shrines. Those with strong enough minds may survive.
