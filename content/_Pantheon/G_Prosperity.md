Prosperity represents Wealth, Give & Take, Love and Healing. Any area of life that might be prosperous, she is a patron to. 

Often it is the people that seek more prosperity that turn to her. Her boons are an equal exchange though. The energy (or wealth) put in, equals the output. 

Many traders also pray to this goddess, appreciating the give and take she represents. 

She is often depicted as a matronly noble lady. Other times she is a young maiden in a wedding gown. The rose is used as an alternative symbol.
