Time is the god of Context, Cycle of life, Nature and Proper order of things. He represents the relationship between past, present and future. 

His followers often firmly believe in the proper passage of time. Things happen in a certain way for a certain reason and nature is a perfect representation of these concepts. The past has an influence on the present, which will cause the future. Instead of being passive, they believe one's actions (or inactions) are highly important. They strive to live very consciously and decide with care.

Monks of [Consistency](../_Pantheon/G_Consistency.md) record the history as has passed. Skilled monks of Time don't need to. They can read the past from the present. Some are even said to be able to read the future or manipulate the flow of time.

Time is often shown as a tall man in a robe with a hood, wearing a mask that covers his eyes. The guide star is also used as a representation because of its cyclical color changes.

**Color:** light gray

**Symbol:** Three vertical lines

**Preferred offering:** meditation, time spent in contemplation. Most rituals are performed at night when the guide star is visible.

**Essence / Power:** OOooo
