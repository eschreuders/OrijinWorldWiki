## Wall at the Heart of the World

The enormous mountain range splitting the world of Orijin through the middle is often called The Grey Wall. Many sorts of humanoids live in this area, but the ones that have made the underground truly theirs are the mountain Dwarves.

They like to think that they are the keepers of the world. They monitor Ashen and watch the world's heart. This sacred place where Orijin is said to have created the Immaterial Gods lies deep beneath the mountains.

The Dwarves have divided themselves in 17 clans, which each are divided in anything from two to 33 houses. Each clan has their own sprawling city quarter beneath the mountains. The city of Greywall is said to be one of the most beautiful and impressive in the world. 

Not many outsiders get to see it though. The Dwarves are very close-knit and like to keep their business a secret. Some houses have made it their business to deal with the outside world, though. They have formed other towns more near the surface where they receive guests from other places.
