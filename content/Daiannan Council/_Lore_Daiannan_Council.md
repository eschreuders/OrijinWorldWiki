## The Colourful Oasis

Daianna, or The Wall-Less City, owes its existence to one of the Three Benign Ladies: [Spark](../_Pantheon/G_Spark.md).

The council is held by representatives of Human, Orc, Gnomish, Hill Dwarf, Halfling and Tabaxi descent.

Legend says the council was created by Spark herself to end a decades-long war over the area’s resources. She rose from the ground in the middle of a battlefield, raised her hand and demanded to speak to the army leaders. The city prides itself with a now centuries-long period of peace.

It’s a large city oasis (some say the largest city in the world) surrounded by a low mountain ridge and endless grasslands. The mountains provide magic ore, used in many a mage tower or artificer lab. The grasslands provide food through trade with the Orcs.

At the heart of the city lies the Grove, a fey-like woodland harboring Spark’s temple and the council hall. No locked doors or walls are present in this area. Outside the Grove is a sprawling city with a very remarkable architecture: a mixture of many different styles and height requirements.

The core of the city, Old Daianna, is made up of the old families and districts, still representing the cultures of centuries past. Surrounding it is New Daianna, where people from over the world have gathered and built an existence over the past 200 years. There’s no visible boundaries or walls between any of the city districts.

Beyond the buildings of New Daianna is a smaller city of tents, The Shift, made up of Orc nomad groups that come and go for trade. The city and mountain-range attracts lots of adventurers, pilgrims and fortune seekers.

**Main gods:** [Spark](../_Pantheon/G_Spark.md), [Current](../_Pantheon/G_Current.md), [Blood](../_Pantheon/G_Blood.md), [Knowledge](../_Pantheon/G_Knowledge.md)

**Politics:** peace is usually the surface level result of hard, hard work. The different people and districts of Daianna have complex politics and cultural differences. Little shifts may cause big changes. There’s a strong arm of the law, but also a centuries-old underground.

**Terrain:** Mainly urban. Some venturing out into the plains or mountains where old ruins lie.
