First actual name: Jenithia. Sister to Kin Iagwenny and aunt to [Strife](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Player%20Characters%2FPC_Strife%20(Innevgai)%20Iagwenny), Glory has built quite the empire in the Manaia Harbor.

Used to be the tavern keep of a luxury dive called The Temple. When the temple banned alcohol, she lead a couple of other establishment owners to the underdocks. At the same time she established a smuggling network for the city Manaia. Elves love their booze. Before the ban they wouldn't deal with her, but now? Business is going well.

Everyone who likes a party goes to the underdocks now. The temple doesn't seem to regulate too strictly.

Kin and Glory started Dock3 together when they were younger. Glory used to get the attention of many men, but the one she fell in love for, married her sister. That was when she decided to travel and ended up in Manaia.

**Disposition:** Loud, Jovial. Loves her money. Has a softness for people she's close to.
