Imavar, age 192 is the current king of the high elves in Manaia. His symbol is the bear. Direct descendant of ==Imvyr Amakiir-Im==. He wields no actual wordly power, which is all overseen by the temple. He is an intellectual and student of world cultures though. 

Open and secret correspondence with a select few people has enabled him to gather quite the manuscript collection for the university. Contacts: [Pendoril Silverwing](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Confederation%20of%20Cernia%2FTradecity%20Tosh%2FMage%20Quarter%2FC_Pendoril%20Silverwing) from Tradecity Tosh, ==Ariadna Catrys== from Three Sister Kingdom, ==Hymna Portridge== from Fahlia.

Believer in experience, but has little. Most of his life is staged. Therefore he tries bringing the outside world to others and learn from books.

### Beliefs in politics
He believes Imvyr was right to have contacted the humans. He regrets the fact that the royal line has split over it. 

His wish is to unite the lines. The temple is pushing for him to marry. They benefit from the current situation. Leaving Manaia and trying to contact the other bloodline will force the temple to prevent information about the situation from coming out. 

Maranos had visited him so they could speak about their differences. The two plan to bring peace back to the royal family. Maranos has gone to the Summit temple to pray to Balance there and to find the legend of the brothers which should hold the cure for the curse.

Imavar is willing to give up power, yet the temple isn't and the people love him and not the wood elves. They want to use the original legend words to solve the matter.
