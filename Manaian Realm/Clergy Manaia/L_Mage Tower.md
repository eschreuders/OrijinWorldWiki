Two spires rise up from the city. One is the palace of the king. One is the mage tower.
Located near the edge of town and with one side facing the mountain forest.

It is extremely tall and thin, defying the laws of gravity. The top of it is clad in silver, shining in the sun. The walls of it are lit with magical lanterns, offsetting the engraved images of nature, mages of old and creatures from before the age of balance.
