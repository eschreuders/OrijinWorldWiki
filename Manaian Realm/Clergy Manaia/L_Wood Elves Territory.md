Home to the so called wood elves. Some have this ancestry, some are banished or have chosen to live here.

There are many small settlements scattered through the forest. The only thing they have in common, is that they do not recognize the capital's government. Not all of them have the same goals or type of rule. Some are centered around belief, others around politics. Some are good aligned, some evil or neutral. Some war amongst each other.

A party of representatives of the old city has gone to Manaia and not returned. 

## The old Town (Urephira)

Largest settlement where the original wood elves live. Also some humans and half elves. They believe anyone following their way of life and believing in the truth of the Amakiir-al as true leaders is welcome.

Most follow balance as a goddess, but their main focus is not religion or bringing a new age of balance. Their vision is that balance is already present in nature and that the equilibrium should be preserved. These people are generally peaceful, but do not shy away from fighting as it is a way of nature as well.

**Ruling family**: The wood elf branch of Amakiir: ==Amakiir-al==. Members of this family undergo a ritual changing them into were tigers. They are legendary because they cannot be hit by normal weapons. 

**Trouble/tension**: The capital banishing soft liners to wood elves territory is causing bandit camps around the forest which break the balance. The current king, ==**Taenamas Amakiir-al**==, believes in a peaceful solution. Voices are rising for more rigorous measures.

## New Settlements
There are many different additional settlements. Some of small-time criminals from the capital. Some are gatherings of religious officials, being banished for differing opinions with the regime. Others of people choosing to leave the capital for new chances, but feeling at home with the old settlement.

**Most important settlement: ==Umecain== (new beginning)**, with leader ==**Renlynn Saltris**==. Ex head priest of Balance. She believes in the truth of Amakiir-in as the true leaders of the elves. Yet, she disagrees with the current religious regime's focus on forcing balance.
