The manaian Realm is made up out of two rules: the [Clergy Manaia](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FL_Clergy%20Manaia) and the [Old City Urephira](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=Manaian%20Realm%2FClergy%20Manaia%2FL_Wood%20Elves%20Territory). Maiana has established trade and relations with outsiders and is generally known as the Elven capital. However, Urephira and Manaia in fact are still in dispute about which royal family branch has the true bloodline.

## History
Two bloodlines exist: **Amakiir-al and Amakiir-im**. 
Legend has it that there once was a single royal bloodline Amakiir. The true forefather of this line was the one saving the world of destruction and starting the current age, ==Ridaro==. Since the age started with a plague killing all adults and only the youngest survived, little knowledge is left.

The original Amakiir twin brothers, ==**Allythu and Imvyr**==, ruled from Urephira. Manaia was a temple city, bearing the temples and essences of balance. Pilgrimage to the mountain where this temple was located was common.

The time came, when traders from downriver tried to establish relations. Allythu was in favor of keeping to the old ways of seclusion and trusting the balance of the world. Nature would provide everything needed. Balance was innately set. 

Imvyr observed that the humans with their numbers and enterprising nature would not just go back downriver and stay there, not for long. He also saw the potential of trade: opening up possibilities for art and further worship of Balance, influencing Balance downriver. With one brother in favor and one not, relationships got tense. 

The more impulsive Invyr decided to meet with the humans in secret. When Allythu found out, he  felt immeasurable rage. He stormed the meeting hall, calling upon the boons of Balance and she answertd his prayer: he changed into a tiger before everyone's eyes.

But Balance wouldn't be herself if she hadn't heard the prayer of the other as well. The humans stared in shock as Imvyr changed into a bear. The brothers fought a bloody battle. Finally, Imvyr fled into the forest.

He ran to the temple of Balance where the priests took him in.
Ever since, both branches of royal family, the bear and the tiger, claim ultimate rule over all elves. The conflict is frozen as the Amakiir-Im from the capital have established relations with downriver and are the most wealthy. The Amakiir-Al maintain balance in the forest and the old city.

The split of wood elves and high elves propagated as the influence of Balance's boon spread to the peoples of these kings. Wood elves tend more to earthy skin tones and darker hair. Their personalities are more fierce and passionate. The high elves are taller, lighter in coloring and more likely to enjoy the comforts of life, be a little more on the mellow side and more likely to compromise.

## Politics

Current relations between Urephira and Manaia are tense but there is a non-aggression treaty. Urephira knows that Maiana would have the upperhand in a battle. They have adopted the concept of a mage tower from the humans and have access to way more powerful magic. 

Maiana wishes for the status to stay as it is. Urephira is largely invisible and they make a decent profit. So: they need a living king to keep Amakiir-Al from trying to take over. They also need this king to not bother with whatever they want. De facto the clergy is really what rules.

Urephira frowns and sometimes scowls at Manaia's ways, but they recognise that the presence of the temple there must mean that balance is clean enough. Besides, they can't deny the benefits of trade.
