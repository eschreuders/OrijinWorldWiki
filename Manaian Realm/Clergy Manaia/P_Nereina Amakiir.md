The archmage Nereina Amakiir, or the legendary Ridaro Amakiir. Has saved the world from destruction by making a wish at the end of the age of balance. Now she believes this world is a fake and wants to end its existence to start over yet again in her old world.

She has secretly taken over a sect of Balance, believing in the goddess as the only true one, with the lost one as her son. She has convinced its members that the only way to restore balance is with chaos. An adapted version of the Dream spell has let her brainwash elves who normally wouldn't dream.
