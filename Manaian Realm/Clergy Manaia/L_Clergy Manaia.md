#location #manaianrealm 

City built in the shadow of a tall, icy mountain peak. The maiana flow branches off into its harbor. 

## Harbor
White marble docks, carefully cleaned. Officials checking everything coming in. Three tiers in a half-circle.

### Thri gates:

Check for valid proof of entrance. If you don't have Elven blood, you need a reference to get into town. This reference will be checked.

Guards: there arenâ€™t any guards patrolling the streets. The flying creatures are flying around town, keeping things in check and fetching guards wehn people break balance. 

### The City
Past the three gates is the city itself, catering to elves. In this part of Manaia is the mage tower and the university. The king's palace is a spire in the middle of town.

### Balance's gate. 
At the feet of a 30 feet tall statue of an elf woman carrying perfectly balanced scales. They are closed. They say the gates only open for those called for special temple business.

### Temple district
The temple of balance and all of its additional buildings is located here. This is the true seat of power.
