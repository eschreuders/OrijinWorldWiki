### The Mad God Orijin

At one point there was Orijin. And Orijin was all there was. Being alone and constant, Orijin got bored with their state and they split from their own being three entities. These were the Immaterial Gods: ==Ocheean, Lannod and Scye==.

Orijin's children were very different from each other for they represented different pieces of a whole. The ocean was fluid and ever changing, moving themselves with determined grace. The land was constant and patient, watching his siblings' actions with wonder. The sky was constantly in change and turmoil, creating her sparks of light, life and emotion.

Orijin watched with amusement as the three coexisted, fought and collided, trying to claim a space in the universe. Ocheean washed over Lannod and blocked Scye with its being. Scye sprayed and battered the Ocheean and its stormy nature eroded Lannod. Lannod watched all and stayed, shifting and shaping its mass barely and slowly. As the other two tried to influence him, he simply persevered or took a small step to the side.

It took immeasurable time, but eventually the three found a middle ground. Their give and take reached a state of peace and from the love and acceptance a fourth god was created: Offshoot ==Balance==. 

Balance was a being made of matter. She could freely move between the land, sky and ocean and use the gifts of all.


### ~ End of the First Age of Balance ~

Orijin frowned as their three children had now created a being of their own and the world had returned to a state of stability. Apparently splitting up was not enough to create a lasting effect. Instead, Orijin added something new to the world: a wish, something to want for.

The results were four new beings of matter, made to challenge Balance: Desires ==Blood, Knowledge, Ending and Prosperity.== 

Like Balance, the four desires could also move freely between sky, land and ocean and no matter where Balance tried to hide, eventually they would always find her. Balance, simply wanting to be left alone, called out for help to her three parents. The Immaterial Gods did not know how to end the hunt, but got together and decided to level the playing field. 

Each of them split off two of its aspects, much like Orijin had once done to create them.
Lannod offered its ==Consistency== in being and the ==Time== of the ages. Scye gave up its ==Spark== of light and life and the ==Current== of its emotion and the winds. Ocheean personified the tricky ==Fluidity== and the violence of the ==Flood==.

The six new beings of matter were added to the world and a new imbalance was struck. The desires and aspects shaped the world, trying to carve out a piece for themselves, much like the three first gods had in the aeons before. Balance was no longer the hunted, but she grieved nonetheless as the other siblings fought. Part of her wanted to leave the world and part of her longed for a new age of peace.


Torn by grief, she cast off her cloak and it sprawled across the floor, coming to life as The ==Lost One==. Too weak to partake in the war, he took whatever the others left untouched. He scooped up the leftovers and granted them his blessing, casting a mournful, but comforting shadow. Balance felt strengthened after she had gotten rid of her grief. With renewed strength she forged an alliance between her brothers and sisters.


### ~ End of the Second Age of Balance ~

Meanwhile, in the heavens Orijin was steaming with rage. They could not fathom that they were forever doomed to return to a state of sameness and peace. The cursing and raging of the God of creation filled the sky, shook the earth and caused tidal waves that flushed over whole continents. All the desires, offshoots and aspects shuddered in their domains.

During this spell of divine rage, all the mortal creatures were called into creation. Orijin fell apart in so many pieces, that they lost the ability to keep their children together. The Twelve watched in horror as Orijin, Ocheean, Lannod and Scye were all torn into millions of tiny shatters and filled the world in an unending cycle of birth and death.


This third imbalance was the greatest so far. The Twelve did not agree on the way to fix it and went separate ways. This time they fought for influence with the people of the world, for the one who would possess the most of creation, would undoubtedly shape the future for aeons to come.


### ~ Ending Any Age of Balance ~

Many ages of chaos would follow, ending in ages of Balance. The world forever oscillating between states of turmoil and peace. Peace might be for a long or short time, but each time it would be marked by Balance walking the earth and holding council in her temple. Her essence in hand.

Whenever an age of Balance would be broken, the people of the world would start counting the days and years until peace would be reached once more.
