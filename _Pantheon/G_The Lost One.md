The god of Death, grief and mercy. Yet also the god of travelers and lost souls. No matter the kind of journey, everyone on a lonely path can be scooped up by this offshoot of Balance. 

The Lost One was born from [Balance's](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Balance) grief. Torn by the fighting of her parents, she threw her cloak on the floor which then took physical form.
Some view The Lost One as a lesser god, sprung from Balance instead of the old Pantheon. 
Others see Him as the child of Balance and the Deiety closest to all mortals, therefore stronger than the other gods.

The Lost One himself is nondescript, secret and easy to miss. The teachings that portray him as closer to the mortal world than the other gods say he may appear to his believers in physical form: a beggar on the road, a raven on a graveyard, a stray dog...
