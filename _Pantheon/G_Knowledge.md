God of understanding, neutrality and completeness.

Followers of this aspect look for a deeper understanding of the world and all that lives in it. 
They believe deeper knowledge will lead to this understanding and to a more whole world altogether.

In contrast with [Balance](obsidian://open?vault=World%20Wiki&file=_Pantheon%2FG_Balance), Knowledge does not seek to fix the world and force equilibrium.
He observes and steps in where the situation calls for it, inspired by intuition (or divine calling).

Often disciples of Knowledge will pursue a trade or craft to the best they can in honor of their god. This god is a fairly silent one, although some say he uses spirit fire to communicate with his closest followers.
